<div class="p"><p>Applied mathematics is a field of mathematics that considers the application of mathematical methods
    and algorithms in other fields of science and practice. Examples of such applications are: numerical methods,
    mathematical physics, linear programming, optimization and research of operations, modeling of continuous media
    (mechanics of continuous media), and bioinformatics, information theory, game theory, probability
    theory and mathematical statistics, financial mathematics and insurance theory, cryptography, graph theory in
    applications to network planning, and in many ways what is called computer science.</p></div>
