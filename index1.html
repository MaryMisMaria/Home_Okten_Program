<h1>World of the Cat</h1>
<p>Cats are very cute and graceful animals. These animals turn into four paws, jump well and contain climbs on a tree.
    More cats cover quickly and have a long tail.
    These animals can be wild or domestic. A cat is a popular pet. Its size allows you to keep a cat in the house or
    apartment. She does not need special living conditions, but she needs enough space to play, enter properly and live
    clean.</p>

<h2>Habits of the cats</h2>
<p>Cats are predators. This means that in nature they forage for food and eat the meat of other animals. Cats that live
    on the street or in the village, catch mice, other rodents, small birds. Domestic cats are fed by their owners, but
    they also do not mind hunting for a sunny bunny or a sparrow sitting on the windowsill.</p>
